# streamlit-sphere-volume
This is my first streamlit app deployed on heroku for calculating sphere volume.
Objective of this web is to calculate sphere volume by input the radius that user want.
If you curious that I've been done, please visit <a href="http://streamlit-volume-sphere.herokuapp.com/"><a>.
I'm creating this project by watching tutorial from this channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ7rGcE766k"><a>.
Good luck!
