# streamlit-sphere-volume
This is My first streamlit app deployed on heroku for calculating sphere volume.
If you curious that I've been done, please visit http://streamlit-volume-sphere.herokuapp.com/.
Objective of this web is to calculate sphere volume by input the radius that user want.
I'm creating this project using this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ7rGcE766k.
Good luck!
